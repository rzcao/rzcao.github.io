I am a postdoctorial researcher at UC Berkeley working with Prof. <a ref = "laurawaller.com">Laura Waller</a>. Prior to joining Berkeley, I earned my Master (2021) and Ph.D. (2024) degrees at Caltech under the guidance of Prof. <a ref = "https://biophot.sites.caltech.edu/">Changhuei Yang</a>, where I developed techniques for counteracting aberration and scattering.
