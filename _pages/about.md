I am a postdoctorial researcher at UC Berkeley working with Prof. Laura Waller. Prior to joining Berkeley, I earned my bachelor degree in Optical Engineering at Zhejiang University when I gained interest in the field of optical imaging. I finished my Master and Ph.D. degrees at Caltech under the guidance of Prof. Changhuei Yang, where I developed techniques for counteracting aberration and scattering.
